Writing clear and effective test cases is essential for ensuring software works well and is reliable. Well-crafted test cases provide a step-by-step guide for testers, making sure all parts of the software are thoroughly tested. They help find issues, confirm that the software behaves as expected, and contribute to the overall quality assurance process, making the product more dependable.

### **1. Understand the Requirements Thoroughly**

Before creating test cases, it is important to have a deep understanding of the project’s requirements. Test cases should always be mapped to specific requirements or user stories to ensure that all functionalities are tested properly.

**Best Practice Tip:**

- Always link each test case to the relevant requirement or user story.
- Clarify any ambiguities in requirements with stakeholders before starting the test case design.

### **2. Keep Test Cases Simple and Clear**

Simplicity is key when writing test cases. Test cases should be concise, clear, and easy to understand by anyone involved in the project, whether they are testers, developers, or business analysts. Avoid using complex language or unnecessary technical jargon.

**Best Practice Tip:**

- Use short, descriptive sentences for each test step.
- Ensure the test case title clearly reflects what the test will validate.

### **3. Write Test Cases from the End-User’s Perspective**

When creating test cases, always think from the perspective of the end-user. This ensures that the tests focus on real-world scenarios and the user’s experience while interacting with the system.

**Best Practice Tip:**

- Simulate typical user actions, ensuring all critical workflows are tested.
- Create both **positive test cases** (valid inputs) and **negative test cases** (invalid inputs or edge cases).

**Example:**

- **Positive Test Case:** Verify that the user can successfully log in with valid credentials.
- **Negative Test Case:** Verify that an error message is displayed when invalid credentials are entered.

### **4. Include Clear and Detailed Steps**

Each test case should have detailed steps that testers can follow to execute the test successfully. Make sure that the steps are specific and ordered logically to guide the tester through the process. This minimizes errors and misinterpretation during test execution.

**Best Practice Tip:**

- Include precise information on data inputs and actions for each test step.
- Specify expected outcomes at each step.
- **Variations and Edge Cases:**

Identify and include variations and edge cases in your test cases. Ensure test cases cover positive and negative scenarios.

### **5. Dependency Management**

Clearly identify any dependencies between test cases. Document dependencies on external factors (e.g., specific data states, and configurations).

### **6. Reusability**

Design test cases to be reusable across different scenarios. Avoid redundant or duplicate test cases.

### **7. Data Independence**

Ensure test cases do not rely on specific data states from previous tests. Use setup and teardown procedures to maintain data independence.

### **8. Test Case Priority:**

Assign priorities to test cases based on criticality and business impact. Communicate priority levels.

### **Priority Scale Example:**

- P0 (Priority 0): Critical - Must be tested before any other test cases. Failure of these tests results in a showstopper.
- P1 (Priority 1): High - Important functionalities that, if they fail, would significantly impact the application.
- P2 (Priority 2): Medium - Important but not critical functionalities that contribute significantly to the user experience.
- P3 (Priority 3): Low - Less critical functionalities or scenarios that can tolerate some issues without severe impact.
- P4 (Priority 4): Deferred - Can be tested at a later stage; lower in priority.

### **Considerations for Assigning Priority:**

- Business Impact: Consider the impact on business processes and end-users.
- Critical Functionality: Identify critical functionalities that are essential for the application's purpose.
- Risk Assessment: Evaluate the potential risks associated with each test case.
- Dependencies: Consider dependencies between different features or functionalities.
- Time Constraints: Assess the available time for testing and prioritize accordingly.

### **9. Execution Environment:**

Specify test environment requirements, including configurations, browsers, devices, etc.

### **10. Automation Considerations:**

Identify test cases suitable for automation. Include guidelines for creating automation-friendly test cases.

### **11. Review and Approval:**

Establish a review process for test cases before execution. Define roles and responsibilities for reviewing and approving test cases. Make sure your test cases are reviewed by peers and the feedback given by them is incorporated.

### **12. Maintainability:**

Emphasize the importance of keeping test cases up-to-date. Specify procedures for updating test cases in response to changes in requirements or application features.

### **13. Test Case Structure:**

### **Template for documenting test cases:**

- **Test Case ID:** [Unique identifier for the test case]
- **Description:** [Brief description of the test case]
- **Preconditions:** [Conditions that must be met before executing the test case
- **Browser:** Add different browsers and devices which this TS to be tested(like Chrome, Android - Samsung Galaxy A7, iOS - Iphone 11 OS Version 17)
- **Test Data:** [Specify the required test data]
- **Priority:**
- **Test Steps:**

[Step 1]

- **Expected Results:** [Expected outcome after executing the test steps]
- **Actual Results:** [Actual outcome after test execution]
- **Status:** [Pass/Fail/Blocked]

## **Test Case Names/Description:**

Ensure that test case names are descriptive and reflect the functionality or scenario being tested.

- **Keep It Concise:** The test description should be brief and to the point. Avoid unnecessary details that belong in the test steps or expected results.
- **Be Specific:** Clearly communicate the focus and objective of the test case. Testers should understand what to expect without ambiguity.
- Use Action Verbs: Start the description with a verb that conveys the action being tested (e.g., Verify, Confirm, Ensure). Right keywords help convey the purpose, scope, and expectations of the test case effectively.
  - **Verify ->** Example: "To Verify that the system prevents login when both the username and password fields are empty."
  - **Ensure->** Example: "Ensure that the application displays an appropriate error message when a user attempts to log in with an incorrect password."
  - **Confirm->** Example: "Confirm that the system redirects users to their respective dashboards upon successful login with valid credentials."
  - **Validate->**  Example: "Validate that the 'Forgot Password' link prompts users to reset their password and sends a confirmation email."
  - **Check->** Example: "Check that the system handles concurrent user logins gracefully without unexpected errors."
- Adapt for Complexity: For more complex scenarios, the test description may need to provide additional context or conditions.

## **Traceability:**

Link test cases to corresponding requirements or user stories. Reference-related documents or artifacts.

## **Preconditions:**

Clearly state any preconditions necessary for the successful execution of the test case. Ensure preconditions are realistic and achievable.

## **Test Data:**

Specify the test data required for the test case. Provide guidelines for creating or obtaining test data. Below are some guidelines for obtaining test data with an example scenario.

- Use Realistic Data : Example: Use names, email addresses, and addresses that resemble real user information, such as "John Doe," "john.doe@email.com," and a valid address.
- Generate Synthetic Data: Example: Use names, email addresses, and addresses that resemble real user information, such as "John Doe," "john.doe@email.com," and a valid address.
- Dynamic Data Generation: Example: Develop scripts to dynamically generate fresh test data for each registration test, ensuring data consistency and avoiding dependencies on static data.
- Vary Data Types: Example: Include variations in data types, such as using special characters in the name (e.g., "John$Doe") to test how the application handles diverse inputs.
- Include Boundary Values: Test the registration form with boundary values, such as a very short name ("J") and a very long name ("JohnDoeWithAVeryLongNameThatExceedsTheCharacterLimit")
- Refresh Data Regularly: Regularly update or refresh the test data to reflect any changes in the registration process or application logic.

## **Test Steps:**

Break down test cases into clear and sequential steps. Use action verbs to describe each step. Keep steps simple and focused on one action.

- **Start with an Action Verb:**
  - Begin each test step with a clear and action-oriented verb.
  - Example: "Navigate to the login page," "Enter the username," "Click the Submit button."
- **Keep it simple and Specific**
  - Break down complex actions into simple, specific steps.
  - Example: Instead of "Perform the login process," break it down into steps like "Enter username," "Enter password," and "Click login."
- **One Action per step:**
  - Focus each step on a single action or operation.
  - Example: Instead of "Enter username and password," separate into two steps: "Enter username" and "Enter password."
- **Include Preconditions:**
  - Clearly state any prerequisites or preconditions necessary for the test step.
  - Example: "Given that the user is on the homepage," "Assuming a valid login session."
- **Be Explicit:**
  - Specify exactly what the tester should do, avoiding ambiguity.
  - Example: Instead of "Complete the form," specify the individual form fields and their expected values.
- **Use Consistent Language:**
  - Maintain a consistent style and language throughout the test steps.
  - Example: If you start with "Click the button," continue with "Click the button" rather than switching to "Press the button."
- **Include Test Data:**
  - Incorporate the relevant test data within the test step.
  - Example: "Enter 'user@example.com' in the email field," "Select 'Option A' from the dropdown menu."
- **Avoid Technical Jargon:**
  - Write test steps in a language that is easily understandable by all team members, including non-technical stakeholders.
  - Example: Instead of using technical terms, use plain language to describe actions.
- **Maintain Logical Order:**
  - Organize test steps in a logical sequence, following the natural flow of the user's actions or system processes.
  - Example: "Navigate to the product catalog," "Select a product," "Add the product to the cart."

## **Expected Results:**

Define the expected outcome of each test step. Ensure expected results are specific, measurable, and verifiable.

**Be Specific and Measurable:**

- Clearly specify the expected outcome in a way that is specific and measurable.
- Example: "The system should display a success message confirming the user's registration."
- **Align with Test Objective:**
  - Ensure that the expected result aligns with the overall objective of the test case.
  - Example: If testing a login feature, the expected result might be, "The user should be successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard."
- **Use Actionable Language:**
  - Frame expected results using actionable language, describing what the system or user should do.
  - Example: "The application should highlight the selected item in the product catalog."
- **Include Relevance to User Goals:**
  - Relate expected results to the goals or tasks the end user is trying to accomplish.
  - Example: "Upon clicking 'Submit,' the system should process the form and redirect the user to the confirmation page."
- **Ensure Consistency:**
  - Maintain consistency in the language and formatting of expected results across test cases.
  - Example: If using "should," "must," or "will" to express expectations, use it consistently.
