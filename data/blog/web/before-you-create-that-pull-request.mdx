- Maintain consistency in wording, tone, and style across all messages to ensure a cohesive user experience.
- Ensure there are no English grammar or spelling mistakes in any UI text, tooltips, or documentation.
- Review messages for clarity, ensuring they provide helpful guidance to users instead of being vague or confusing.
- If applicable, provide alternative wording for technical errors that non-technical users can understand easily.

### Data, empty state, and load more

- [Design and implement empty state UI gracefully by displaying meaningful messages or illustrations instead of blank screens to enhance the user experience](https://niamh-oshea.medium.com/the-art-of-designing-empty-states-316ca7a6be94)
- Provide helpful guidance to users, especially for first-time interactions, ensuring they understand what to do next.
- Implement proper pagination, infinite scrolling, or lazy loading where applicable to improve performance and usability.
- Ensure that the "Load More" button or auto-loading functionality works seamlessly without delays, glitches, or unexpected behavior.
- Manage error states effectively by displaying appropriate messages when data fails to load, ensuring users are informed of the issue and possible next steps.

- Avoid unnecessary API calls that may lead to performance issues, excessive server load, or increased data usage.
- Use proper caching strategies, batch requests, or efficient pagination techniques to optimize data fetching and improve performance.
- Implement progress indicators and informative messages for users when loading takes longer than expected.
- Test the application under various network conditions (3G, slow Wi-Fi, offline mode) to ensure stability, responsiveness, and usability even in low-bandwidth scenarios.
- Ensure error handling mechanisms gracefully manage network failures, providing users with retry options or fallback content instead of abrupt failures.

### API Guidelines

- Implement proper error status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access, 500 for server errors etc) and ensure APIs are versioned (v1, v2, etc.) for backward compatibility.
- [Ensure API calls follows RESTful API best practices, maintaining a consistent and scalable structure.](https://blog.crownstack.com/blog/web/crownstack-rest-api-guidelines)
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET for retrieving data, POST for creating resources, PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for removal etc.) and avoid misuse of methods.
- Handle API errors gracefully with meaningful error messages, structured responses, and appropriate fallback mechanisms to prevent application crashes.
- Ensure proper naming conventions are followed for endpoints, request parameters, and response structures to maintain clarity and predictability.
- Optimize API responses by minimizing payload size, using compression techniques, and sending only the required fields to improve performance.
- Secure APIs by implementing authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth, API keys) and validating incoming requests to prevent abuse.
- Use rate limiting and throttling to prevent excessive API calls and improve system stability.
- Test API responses for edge cases, such as invalid input, missing parameters, and large datasets, to ensure reliability.

### Database

- Ensure proper database indexing to optimize query performance, reduce lookup time, and enhance overall efficiency.
- Implement query optimization techniques such as indexing, caching, and avoiding full table scans to maintain performance as data volume increases.
- Use clear, descriptive, and consistent table column names to improve readability, maintainability, and future scalability of the database schema.
- [Apply data normalization to eliminate redundancy, reduce anomalies, and improve data integrity across all database tables](https://medium.com/@ajayverma23/data-normalization-unlocking-efficiency-and-integrity-in-your-database-d94bdcc74cf0)
- Define appropriate table constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, NOT NULL, default values) to enforce data consistency and accuracy.
- [Avoid N+1 queries by using eager loading where necessary to optimize database queries and reduce the number of unnecessary database calls](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/n-plus-one-query-problem/)
- Identify and remove duplicate database queries, redundant joins, and unnecessary fetch operations to enhance database performance.
- If applicable, implement proper data migration strategies to handle schema changes effectively while preventing data loss or inconsistencies.
- Use transactions where necessary to maintain atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) in critical database operations.
- Monitor database performance metrics and optimize slow queries using tools like EXPLAIN ANALYZE in SQL-based databases.
- Ensure proper data retention policies are in place, including archival strategies for old or unused records to improve database efficiency.
