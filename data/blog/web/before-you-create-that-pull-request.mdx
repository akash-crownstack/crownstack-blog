A pull request (PR) involves more than just pushing your code and having it merged. It focuses on maintaining code quality, ensuring a smooth user experience, and avoiding unexpected issues. Before you click the 'Create PR' button, consider these essential steps to follow:

- UI Implementation
- Type Error and Messaging
- Data, Empty State, Load More
- Data Loading with Slow Network
- API Guidelines
- Database
- Documentation
- Code Refactoring
- Testing (E2E), Test Case Results
- Pull Request Checklist

### UI Implementation

- Ensure the UI looks and behaves as expected and the design matches the approved mockups.
- The layout must be responsive across different screen sizes.
- UI components should be consistent with the existing design system and make those reusable.
- Interactive elements like buttons, forms, and models should work as intended.
- Verify color schemes, typography, and spacing align with a design system
- Make sure all basic form validations are there and proper error handling is being done

### Type error and messaging(Grammer)

- Use clear, user-friendly language and include action items when applicable
- Maintain consistency in error message format and log detailed errors for debugging
- Ensure there are no TypeScript or JavaScript type errors.
- Validate error messages and notifications are grammatically correct and easy to understand.
- Maintain consistency in wording and tone.
- Ensure no english grammar or spelling errors are there

### Data, empty state, and load more

- Design and implement empty state UI gracefully (e.g., show friendly messages instead of blank screens).
- Provide helpful guidance to users and consider first-time user experience
- Implement proper pagination or infinite scrolling where applicable.
- Ensure that the 'Load More' button or auto-loading works seamlessly.
- Manage error states when needed

### Data loading with slow network

- Consider using the DataLoader pattern and implement loading states
- Add retry mechanisms, Cache responses when possible, and Use optimistic updates
- Avoid unnecessary API calls that may lead to performance issues.
- Use proper caching, batch requests, or pagination to optimize data fetching.
- Test on slow network conditions to ensure the app remains stable and usable.

### API Guidelines

- Implement proper error status codes and version your APIs
- [Ensure API calls follows RESTful API best practices](https://blog.crownstack.com/blog/web/crownstack-rest-api-guidelines)
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.)
- Handle API errors gracefully with appropriate fallback mechanisms.
- Ensure proper naming conventions are being followed

### Database

- Ensure proper database indexing for optimized query performance
- Implement query optimization techniques to maintain performance as data volume increases
- Use clear and consistent table column names for readability and maintainability.
- [Apply data normalization to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity](https://medium.com/@ajayverma23/data-normalization-unlocking-efficiency-and-integrity-in-your-database-d94bdcc74cf0)
- Define appropriate table constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) and validations
- [Avoid N+1 queries by using eager loading where necessary](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/n-plus-one-query-problem/)
- Identify and remove duplicate database queries to enhance performance

### Documentation

- Update API documentation consistently.
- Ensure the README file is clear and up-to-date.
- Revise help guides with any changes made to specific features.
- Keep code comments updated if modifications are made to the corresponding functions or methods.
- Ensure Swagger documentation reflects the latest API changes.
- Regularly update the status of JIRA tickets to reflect progress accurately.
- Implement and maintain test cases to ensure reliability and catch regressions.

### Code Refactoring

- Remove unused variables, functions, and console logs.
- Consolidate duplicate logic and break down complex functions
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Ensure the code is clean, modular, and well-structured.
- [Follow best practices for readability and maintainability](https://blog.crownstack.com/blog/roadmaps/code-smells-and-code-refactoring)

### Testing (E2E), Test case result

- Make sure sanity/smoke testing has been performed properly
- Run automated tests (unit, integration, and E2E) to ensure functionality.
- Validate test case results and ensure coverage for new changes.
- Fix any failing tests before submitting the PR.
- [Write clear and effective test cases](https://blog.crownstack.com/blog/qa/writing-effective-test-cases)
- Make sure CI/CD pipeline should work properly

### Pull request checklist

- The code follows the project style guide and documentation should be updated
- Make sure all tests are passed and there are no console errors or warnings when creating the build
- Make sure you are not exposing any secret keys in your PR, and security implications reviewed
- Provide a clear title and description of the changes.
- [Check all the steps before create PR](https://gist.github.com/katyhuff/845e06656f18784210190e4f46a4aa95)
