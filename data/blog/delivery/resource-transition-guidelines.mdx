In large projects which are running for a long time, it is quite natural that people will move out from the project due to various reasons and new people might join along the way. Therefore a proper project transition plan needs to be there to manage such instances so that projects keep on moving with constant speed. . A project transition from an old to a new resource should be carefully planned and executed to ensure a smooth and successful handover. Here are some steps to facilitate a seamless project transition:

1. **Knowledge Transfer**: The old resource should work closely with the new resource to transfer all relevant knowledge about the project. This includes providing documentation, explaining the project's background, objectives, and current status, and sharing insights into ongoing challenges or risks.
2. **Onboarding and Training:** The new resource should undergo a thorough onboarding process, including training on the project's tools, technologies, and processes. If possible, provide opportunities for hands-on experience and shadowing the old resource during the initial stages.
3. **Clear Communication**: Facilitate open and transparent communication between the old and new resource throughout the transition period. Please encourage them to discuss any questions, concerns, or uncertainties that may arise during the handover process.
4. **Task Handover:** Identify and prioritize the tasks that need to be transferred from the old resource to the new resource. Clearly define responsibilities and ensure a smooth transfer of ongoing tasks, pending items, and critical project deliverables.
5. **Overlapping Period**: If possible, arrange for an overlapping period where both the old and new resources work together on the project. This overlap allows for collaboration, shared insights, and a smoother transition.
6. **Client or Stakeholder Notification**: Inform relevant clients or stakeholders about the upcoming transition to avoid any confusion or disruption in communication channels. Assure them of a seamless handover and continuous support.
7. **Documentation and References:** Ensure that all project documentation is organized and readily accessible for the new resource. This includes technical documents, project plans, issue logs, and any other relevant records.
8. **Review and Quality Check:** Before concluding the handover, conduct a review to ensure that all necessary aspects of the project have been successfully transferred. Perform a quality check on any deliverables provided by the old resource to verify accuracy and completeness.
9. **Support and Follow-up:** Offer ongoing support to the new resource as they settle into their role and the project. Schedule follow-up meetings to address any additional questions or concerns arising after the handover.
10. **Smooth Transition Management:** Assign a project manager or QA team lead to oversee the transition process and ensure that everything progresses smoothly. This person can act as a point of contact for the old and new resources during the handover.
11. **Addressing Questions and Concerns:** The new resource should feel comfortable asking questions and seeking clarification throughout the transition process. The old help should be available to answer queries and address any concerns that may arise.
12. **Gradual Transition:** Plan the transition period in a phased manner. Start with less critical tasks and gradually move to more complex responsibilities. This approach ensures that the new resource becomes proficient while minimizing the risk of major disruptions.
13. **Post-Transition Support**: Even after the formal handover, the old resource should be available for post-transition support, such as answering occasional questions or providing guidance, for a certain period.

By following the above steps and fostering a collaborative and supportive environment, the project transition can happen with minimal disruptions, and the new resource can be well-equipped to continue the project's success.

**The purpose is** to prepare a backup or replacement resource for a client project ready so that the team can recover when someone smoothly leaves the team.

**Benefits of keeping a backup plan ready**

1. Smooth and quick Knowledge transfer without compromising the quality.
2. Reduce or mitigate the risk of existing resource departure or planned/unplanned long vacation.
3. To accommodate the early release of resources in special cases.
4. To ensure that client work will not be affected due to the unavailability of aligned resources for any reason.
5. No impact on the project or client due to change in resource

## **Execution:**

1. Select a suitable member from your team to be ready as a backup or replacement resource.
2. Aligned him on the client project with the main resource.
3. Start the Knowledge Transfer process
4. Share current roles and responsibilities, all documentation on the project
5. The resource should have access to all documentation on Google Drive, tools, and projects.
6. Hand over the relevant documents as per your respective function.
   1. Technical Documents
   2. Project Workflow
   3. Project Test Plan/Test Cases
   4. Requirement Document /High-level flow of the application (If Available)
   5. Design Document
   6. Any other relevant document
7. Resource shadowing involves attending client meetings, making the new resource aware of standard practices in the projects, and sharing do’s and don’ts so the client is not bothered by the change.
8. **The Team Lead will be responsible for the proper handoff** andensuring that the transition is completed on time. The lead can also be asked about KT's regular progress.
9. The existing resource’s accountability is to provide an understanding of the end-to-end application, all documents, and **general awareness about the project and the team.**
10. The KT receiver is accountable for confirming once they have completed the transition and is **also liable to give a reverse KT.**
11. Ensure the **“Project Transition Checklist”** is created and maintained to ensure a smooth project handover to the new resource.
