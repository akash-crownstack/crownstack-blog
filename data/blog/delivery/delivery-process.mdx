Delivery workflow is a set of structured methods for managing tasks, information, and resources throughout a project's lifecycle. It involves organising and overseeing activities to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in achieving project delivery goals.

This workflow is divided into four stages:

- **Onboarding**
- **Execution**
- **Tracking and Monitoring**
- **Closure**

### **Stage 1: Onboarding**

•**Initial Project Handover:** The Sales or Delivery Head communicates the new project details, aligning the team. They share all pre-collected information about the project and client.

• **Initiate:** Once the client signs the contract, the delivery team can begin. The project officially starts with a formal notification to all stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands the project scope and their roles.

• **Onboarding Call:** A call is arranged with the client to introduce both teams, clarify roles and responsibilities, provide a project overview, and set expectations for the collaboration.

• **Onboarding with Trial:** If the project begins with a trial period, we follow a robust, defined process to ensure success. A Tech Buddy is assigned to guide, mentor, and track the candidate.

• **Project Setup:** During the first week of onboarding, we complete all relevant setups, both internally and at the client's end. This includes creating project folders on Google Drive, setting up GitHub and JIRA access, Wiki, Quick Team, Slack, and other necessary tools.

• **Communication Channel:** We establish a communication framework document to ensure seamless coordination and robust collaboration among project stakeholders. The delivery head shares this with the client within a week of project initiation.

• **Initiation Survey:** The delivery team maintains a **project initiation checklist** that lists down all the important tasks that need to be done in onboarding. The team lead or project manager conducts this survey with the project team to ensure everyone is prepared. It covers project goals, setups, communication channels, and tasks necessary for successful project completion.

### **Stage 2: Execution**

Throughout the project lifecycle, ongoing operations and reporting tasks are addressed to review the project across relevant areas (Development, Project Management, Quality Assurance, Reporting, Finance, Design, Management, and Client).

• **Weekly Status Reports**: Project and QA weekly status reports are shared with the client to keep all stakeholders informed and aligned on the project's progress, quality control, and assurance measures.

• **Checklists**: Checklists are run for specific activities (such as deployment and transition) to ensure adherence to best practices and comprehensive execution.

• **Production Deployment:** Ensures all best practices are followed and nothing is overlooked during production deployment.

• **Transition Checklist:** Facilitates a smooth project handover to new resources. [Resource Transition Guidelines and best practices](https://blog.crownstack.com/blog/delivery/resource-transition-guidelines)

• **Quick Team Updates**: Project details are continuously added and updated on Quick Team (including Notes, Milestones, Resource utilization/Schedule, Risks, Goals, Client feedback, Timesheets, To-do's, and Documents) to keep all internal stakeholders informed of the latest updates and project progression.

• **Technical Documentation**: The developer creates technical documentation within a month of project initiation, capturing all relevant technical information. This documentation is updated to reflect any changes or updates introduced during the project.

• **Test Plan**: The tester creates a Test Plan within a month of project initiation to document all relevant testing information. This plan is updated to reflect any changes or updates introduced during the project.

### **Stage 3: Track & Monitor**

• **Review, Track, Monitor, Improvise:** During the project's life cycle, the project is continuously reviewed and Monitored, and relevant improvisations are made and tracked using different tools.

• **Project Checklist:** A project checklist serves as a reminder of what needs to be done and assurance of what has been done once the items are checked off the list. The following surveys & Checklist can be found on this path.

• **Audits/QA Checklist:** Code audits and QA reviews are conducted to ensure that the coding and QA standards are maintained and to improve the product quality we are building. The leads analyze the audit, and relevant findings and
recommendations are shared with the team afterward.

• **Project Analysis:** The Delivery Head and the project team conduct project analyses once a month to monitor the project. This will ensure that we are meeting project objectives as planned during execution.

• **Delivery review:** The delivery head and the client schedule a periodic review meeting to discuss the project's performance and progress and further strengthen the relationship and engagement. All discussions will be documented on the Quick Teams.

### **Stage 4 - Closure**

Project closure starts by formally notifying all stakeholders that the project will be closed. This ensures that everyone understands the next steps of closure and that the documentation handover is completed.

• **Closure checklist**: The lead completes the Project Closure checklist to ensure that each step (like deliverables to your customer, releasing staff, documentation transfer, and informing stakeholders about the project's closure) is followed during the closure and submits it on Quick Team.

• **Team management**: During the closure, the team’s/Client’s access to GitHub and other relevant tools is revoked, resource utilization GitHub and pertinent other tools are revoked, and resource utilization is updated on Quick Team.

• **Handover document**: After the completion of final payments is confirmed, all the codes and documents are handed over to the client.
