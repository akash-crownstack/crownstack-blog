I am an enthusiastic computer engineer who aims to create software solutions that empower businesses, increase customer conversions via simple, elegant, and expressive UX, convert manual activities into digital processes, save time and resources, and help people by converting their ideas & imaginations into digital form. I always want to make bigger, faster, easier, and automated systems for companies to help their businesses grow and serve their customers better.
